# Exercises

## Exercise 1

In this exercise, we will use DNAse hypersensitivity data to explore range operations.

- Use the `AnnotationHub` package to find the `goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwDnase/wgEncodeUwDnaseK562PkRep1.narrowPeak.gz` `GRanges` object. Load
that into R as the variable dnase.

```{r dnase}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah = AnnotationHub()
query(ah, "goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwDnase/wgEncodeUwDnaseK562PkRep1.narrowPeak.gz")
# the thing above should have only one record, so we can 
# just grab it
dnase = query(ah, "goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwDnase/wgEncodeUwDnaseK562PkRep1.narrowPeak.gz")[[1]]
```

- What type of object is dnase?

```{r}
dnase
class(dnase)
```

- What metadata is stored in dnase?

```{r}
mcols(dnase)
```

- How many peaks are on each chromosome?

```{r}
library(GenomicFeatures)
table(seqnames(dnase))
```

- What are the mean, min, max, and median widths of the peaks?

```{r}
summary(width(dnase))
```

- What are the sequences that were used in the analysis? Do the names have "chr" or not? Experiment with changing the
`seqlevelsStyle` to adjust the sequence names. 

```{r}
seqlevels(dnase)
seqlevelsStyle(dnase)
seqlevelsStyle(dnase) = 'ensembl'
seqlevelsStyle(dnase)
seqlevels(dnase)
```

- What is the total amount of "landscape" covered by the peaks? Assume that the peaks do not overlap. What portion
of the genome does this represent?

```{r}
sum(width(dnase))
sum(seqlengths(dnase))
sum(width(dnase))/sum(seqlengths(dnase))
```

## Exercise 2

In this exercise, we are going to load the second DNAse hypersensitivity replicate to investigate overlaps with
the first replicate.

- Use the AnnotationHub to find the second replicate, `goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwDnase/wgEncodeUwDnaseK562PkRep1.narrowPeak.gz`. Load that as `dnase2`.

```{r}
query(ah, "goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwDnase/wgEncodeUwDnaseK562PkRep2.narrowPeak.gz")
# the thing above should have only one record, so we can 
# just grab it
dnase2 = query(ah, "goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwDnase/wgEncodeUwDnaseK562PkRep2.narrowPeak.gz")[[1]]
```

- How many peaks are there in `dnase` and `dnase2`? Are there are similar number?

```{r}
length(dnase)
length(dnase2)
```

- What are the peak sizes for `dnase2`?

```{r}
summary(width(dnase2))
```

- What proportion of the genome does `dnase2` cover?

```{r}
sum(width(dnase))/sum(seqlengths(dnase))
```

- Count the number of peaks from `dnase` that overlap with `dnase2`.

```{r}
sum(dnase %over% dnase2)
```

- Assume that your peak-caller was "too specific" and that you want to expand your peaks
by 50 bp on each end (so make them 100 bp larger). Use a combination of `resize` (and pay
attention to the `fix` argument) and `width` to do this expansion to dnase and call the
new `GRanges` object "dnase_wide".

```{r}
w = width(dnase)
dnase_wide = resize(dnase, width=w+100, fix='center') #make a copy
width(dnase_wide)
```

## Exercise 3

In this exercise, we are going to look at the overlap of DNAse sites relative to genes/transcripts.
To get started, install and load the `TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene` txdb object.

```
BiocManager::install("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene")
library("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene")
kg = TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
```

- Load the transcripts from the knownGene txdb into a variable. What is the class of this object?

```{r}
library("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene")
kg = TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
tx = transcripts(kg)
class(tx)
length(tx)
```

- Read about the `flank` method for GRanges objects. How could you use that to 
get the "promoter" regions of the transcripts? Let's assume that the promoter region is
2kb upstream of the gene.

```{r}
flank(tx,2000)
```

- Instead of using flank, could you do the same thing with the TxDb object? (See `?promoters`).

```{r}
proms = promoters(kg)
```

- Do any of the regions in the promoters overlap with each other? 

```{r}
summary(countOverlaps(proms))
```

- To find overlap of our DNAse sites with promoters, let's collapse overlapping "promoters" to 
just keep the contiguous regions by using `reduce`. 

```{r}
prom_regions = reduce(proms)
summary(countOverlaps(prom_regions))
```

- Count the number of DNAse sites that overlap with our promoter regions.

```{r}
sum(dnase %over% prom_regions)
# if you notice no overlap, check the seqlevels
# and seqlevelsStyle
seqlevelsStyle(dnase) = "UCSC"
sum(dnase %over% prom_regions)
sum(dnase2 %over% prom_regions)
```
- Is this surprising? If we were to assume that the promoter and dnase regions
are "independent" of each other, what number of overlaps would we expect?

```{r}
prop_proms = sum(width(prom_regions))/sum(seqlengths(prom_regions))
prop_dnase = sum(width(dnase))/sum(seqlengths(prom_regions))
# Iff the dnase and promoter regions are 
# not related, then we would expect this number
# of DNAse overlaps with promoters.
prop_proms * prop_dnase * length(dnase) 
```
