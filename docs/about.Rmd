The materials here were originally written to support the course _Statistical Methods in Functional
Genomics_ offered at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. I have borrowed heavily from previous instructors
and from others generous enough to create and share their teaching materials online.

Thanks to (at least):

- Mark Reimers
- Martin Morgan
- Vince Carey
- Stephen Turner
- Rafa Irizarry
- Naomi Altman
- Hadley Wickham
