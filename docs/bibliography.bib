  abstract = "Gene transcription is strictly controlled by the interplay of
              regulatory events at gene promoters and gene-distal regulatory
              elements called enhancers. Despite extensive studies of
              enhancers, we still have a very limited understanding of their
              mechanisms of action and their restricted spatio-temporal
              activities. A better understanding would ultimately lead to
              fundamental insights into the control of gene transcription and
              the action of regulatory genetic variants involved in disease.
              Here, I review and discuss pros and cons of state-of-the-art
              genomics methods to localize and infer the activity of enhancers.
              Among the different approaches, profiling of enhancer RNAs yields
              the highest specificity and may be superior in detecting in vivo
              activity. I discuss their apparent similarities to promoters,
              which challenge the established view of enhancers and promoters
              as distinct entities, and present a unifying model of regulatory
              elements in transcriptional regulation, in which activity,
              transcriptional output and regulatory function is context
              specific.",

  abstract = "Enhancers control the correct temporal and cell-type-specific
              activation of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes.
              Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is
              crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and
              homeostasis. Here we use the FANTOM5 panel of samples, covering
              the majority of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas
              of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers
              share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNA promoters but
              produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short
              unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is strongly related to
              enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory
              programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to
              identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide
              polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous
              enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy,
              which explains gene expression strength rather than expression
              patterns. The online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique
              resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene
              regulation.",

  abstract = "Super-enhancers are clusters of transcriptional enhancers that
              drive cell-type-specific gene expression and are crucial to cell
              identity. Many disease-associated sequence variations are
              enriched in super-enhancer regions of disease-relevant cell
              types. Thus, super-enhancers can be used as potential biomarkers
              for disease diagnosis and therapeutics. Current studies have
              identified super-enhancers in more than 100 cell types and
              demonstrated their functional importance. However, a centralized
              resource to integrate all these findings is not currently
              available. We developed dbSUPER
              (http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/dbsuper/), the first
              integrated and interactive database of super-enhancers, with the
              primary goal of providing a resource for assistance in further
              studies related to transcriptional control of cell identity and
              disease. dbSUPER provides a responsive and user-friendly web
              interface to facilitate efficient and comprehensive search and
              browsing. The data can be easily sent to Galaxy instances, GREAT
              and Cistrome web-servers for downstream analysis, and can also be
              visualized in the UCSC genome browser where custom tracks can be
              added automatically. The data can be downloaded and exported in
              variety of formats. Furthermore, dbSUPER lists genes associated
              with super-enhancers and also links to external databases such as
              GeneCards, UniProt and Entrez. dbSUPER also provides an overlap
              analysis tool to annotate user-defined regions. We believe
              dbSUPER is a valuable resource for the biology and genetic
              research communities.",
