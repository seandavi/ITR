# Appendix -- Swirl

The following is from the [swirl website](http://swirlstats.com/students.html).

> The swirl R package makes it fun and easy to learn R programming and data science. If you are new to R, have no fear. 


To get started, we need to install a new package into R. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('swirl')
```

Once installed, we want to load it into the R workspace so we can use it.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library('swirl')
```

Finally, to get going, start swirl and follow the instructions.

```{r eval=FALSE}
swirl()
```
