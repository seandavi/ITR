# _Bioconductor_ 'infrastructure' for sequence analysis


```{r style, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
options(width=100, max.print=1000)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    eval=as.logical(Sys.getenv("KNITR_EVAL", "TRUE")),
    cache=as.logical(Sys.getenv("KNITR_CACHE", "TRUE")))
```

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(GenomicRanges)
    library(GenomicAlignments)
})
```

We will need to install a few bioconductor packages for this section.

```{r eval=FALSE}
source('https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')
biocLite(c("GenomicAlignments",
           "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19",
           "AnnotationHub",
           "TxDb.Hsapiens.BioMart.igis",
           "rtracklayer",
           "readr",
           "ComplexHeatmap",
           "ggbio"))
```

## Introduction

### Classes, methods, and packages

This section focuses on classes, methods, and packages, with the goal
being to learn to navigate the help system and interactive discovery
facilities.

### Motivation

Sequence analysis is specialized

- Large data needs to be processed in a memory- and time-efficient manner
- Specific algorithms have been developed for the unique
  characteristics of sequence data

Additional considerations

- Re-use of existing, tested code is easier to do and less error-prone
  than re-inventing the wheel.
- Interoperability between packages is easier when the packages share
  similar data structures.

Solution: use well-defined _classes_ to represent complex data;
_methods_ operate on the classes to perform useful functions.  Classes
and methods are placed together and distributed as _packages_ so that
we can all benefit from the hard work and tested code of others.

## _IRanges_ and _GRanges_

The [IRanges][] package defines an important class for specifying
integer ranges, e.g.,
```{r iranges}
library(IRanges)
ir <- IRanges(start=c(10, 20, 30), width=5)
ir
```

There are many interesting operations to be performed on ranges, e.g,
`flank()` identifies adjacent ranges
```{r iranges-flank}
flank(ir, 3)
```

The `IRanges` class is part of a class hierarchy. To see this, ask R for
the class of `ir`, and for the class definition of the `IRanges` class
```{r iranges-class}
class(ir)
getClass(class(ir))
```

Notice that `IRanges` extends the `Ranges` class. Show

Now try entering `?flank` (if not using _RStudio_, enter
`?"flank,<tab>"` where `<tab>` means to press the tab key to ask for
tab completion). You can see that there are help pages for `flank`
operating on several different classes. Select the completion

```{r iranges-flank-method, eval=FALSE}
?"flank,Ranges-method" 
```

and verify that you're at the page that describes the method relevant
to an `IRanges` instance.  Explore other range-based operations.

The [GenomicRanges][] package extends the notion of ranges to include
features relevant to application of ranges in sequence analysis,
particularly the ability to associate a range with a sequence name
(e.g., chromosome) and a strand. Create a `GRanges` instance based on
our `IRanges` instance, as follows
```{r granges}
library(GenomicRanges)
gr <- GRanges(c("chr1", "chr1", "chr2"), ir, strand=c("+", "-", "+"))
gr
```

The notion of flanking sequence has a more nuanced meaning in
biology. In particular we might expect that flanking sequence on the
`+` strand would precede the range, but on the minus strand would
follow it. Verify that `flank` applied to a `GRanges` object has this
behavior.
```{r granges-flank}
flank(gr, 3)
```

Discover what classes `GRanges` extends, find the help page
documenting the behavior of `flank` when applied to a `GRanges` object,

It seems like there might be a number of helpful methods available for
working with genomic ranges; we can discover some of these from the
command line, indicating that the methods should be on the current
`search()` path

```{r granges-methods}
methods(class="GRanges")
```

Notice that the available `flank()` methods have been augmented by the
methods defined in the _GenomicRanges_ package, including those that are relevant (via inheritance) to the _GRanges_ class.

```{r granges-flank-method}
grep("flank", methods(class="GRanges"), value=TRUE)
```

Verify that the help page documents the behavior we just observed.

```{r granges-flank-method-help, eval=FALSE}
?"flank,GenomicRanges-method"
```

Use `help()` to list the help pages in the `GenomicRanges` package,
and `vignettes()` to view and access available vignettes; these are
also available in the Rstudio 'Help' tab.
```{r granges-man-and-vignettes, eval=FALSE}
help(package="GenomicRanges")
vignette(package="GenomicRanges")
vignette(package="GenomicRanges", "GenomicRangesHOWTOs")
```

### The `GRanges` and `GRangesList` classes

Aside: 'TxDb' packages provide an R representation of gene models

```{r txdb}
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
```

`exons()`: _GRanges_

```{r txdb-exons}
exons(txdb)
```


`exonsBy()`: _GRangesList_

```{r txdb-exonsby}
exonsBy(txdb, "tx")
```


_GRanges_ / _GRangesList_ are incredibly useful

- Represent **annotations** -- genes, variants, regulatory elements,
  copy number regions, ...
- Represent **data** -- aligned reads, ChIP peaks, called variants,
  ...

### Algebra of genomic ranges
  
Many biologically interesting questions represent operations on ranges

- Count overlaps between aligned reads and known genes --
  `GenomicRanges::summarizeOverlaps()`
- Genes nearest to regulatory regions -- `GenomicRanges::nearest()`,
  [ChIPseeker][]
- Called variants relevant to clinical phenotypes -- 
  [VariantFiltering][]

_GRanges_ Algebra

- Intra-range methods
    - Independent of other ranges in the same object
    - GRanges variants strand-aware
    - `shift()`, `narrow()`, `flank()`, `promoters()`, `resize()`,
      `restrict()`, `trim()`
    - See `?"intra-range-methods"`
- Inter-range methods
    - Depends on other ranges in the same object
    - `range()`, `reduce()`, `gaps()`, `disjoin()`
    - `coverage()` (!)
    - see `?"inter-range-methods"`
- Between-range methods
    - Functions of two (or more) range objects
    - `findOverlaps()`, `countOverlaps()`, ..., `%over%`, `%within%`,
      `%outside%`; `union()`, `intersect()`, `setdiff()`, `punion()`,
      `pintersect()`, `psetdiff()`

![Alt Ranges Algebra](images/RangeOperations.png)

## _Biostrings_ (DNA or amino acid sequences)

Classes

- XString, XStringSet, e.g., DNAString (genomes),
  DNAStringSet (reads)

Methods --

- [Cheat sheat](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Biostrings/inst/doc/BiostringsQuickOverview.pdf)
- Manipulation, e.g., `reverseComplement()`
- Summary, e.g., `letterFrequency()`
- Matching, e.g., `matchPDict()`, `matchPWM()`

Related packages

- [BSgenome][]
  - Whole-genome representations
  - Model and custom
- [ShortRead][]
  - FASTQ files

Example 

- Whole-genome sequences are distrubuted by ENSEMBL, NCBI, and others
  as FASTA files; model organism whole genome sequences are packaged
  into more user-friendly `BSgenome` packages. The following
  calculates GC content across chr14.

    ```{r BSgenome-require, message=FALSE}
    library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
    chr14_range = GRanges("chr14", IRanges(1, seqlengths(Hsapiens)["chr14"]))
    chr14_dna <- getSeq(Hsapiens, chr14_range)
    letterFrequency(chr14_dna, "GC", as.prob=TRUE)
    ```

## Public Data and Annotation from _AnnotationHub_

### Roadmap Epigenomics Project 

All Roadmap Epigenomics files are hosted
[here](http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/data/byFileType/). If one had to
download these files on their own, one would navigate through the web
interface to find useful files, then use something like the following
_R_ code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/data/byFileType/peaks/consolidated/broadPeak/E001-H3K4me1.broadPeak.gz"
filename <-  basename(url)
download.file(url, destfile=filename)
if (file.exists(filename))
   data <- import(filename, format="bed")
```
This would have to be repeated for all files, and the onus would lie
on the user to identify, download, import, and manage the local disk
location of these files.

AnnotationHub reduces this task to just a few lines of _R_ code 
```{r results='hide', cache=FALSE}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah = AnnotationHub()
epiFiles <- query(ah, "EpigenomeRoadMap")
```
A look at the value returned by `epiFiles` shows us that 
`r length(epiFiles)` roadmap resources are available via 
AnnotationHub.  Additional information about 
the files is also available, e.g., where the files came from
(dataprovider), genome, species, sourceurl, sourcetypes.

```{r}
epiFiles
```

A good sanity check to ensure that we have files only from the Roadmap Epigenomics
project is to check that all the files in the returned smaller hub object
come from _Homo sapiens_ and the `r unique(epiFiles$genome)` genome 
```{r}
unique(epiFiles$species)
unique(epiFiles$genome)
```
Broadly, one can get an idea of the different files from this project 
looking at the sourcetype
```{r}
table(epiFiles$sourcetype)
```
To get a more descriptive idea of these different files one can use:
```{r}
head(sort(table(epiFiles$description), decreasing=TRUE))
```

The 'metadata' provided by the Roadmap Epigenomics Project is also
available. Note that the information displayed about a hub with a
single resource is quite different from the information displayed when
the hub references more than one resource.
```{r}
metadata.tab <- query(ah , c("EpigenomeRoadMap", "Metadata"))
metadata.tab
```

So far we have been exploring information about resources, without
downloading the resource to a local cache and importing it into R.
One can retrieve the resource using `[[` as indicated at the
end of the show method

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
metadata.tab <- ah[["AH41830"]]
```

```{r}
metadata.tab <- ah[["AH41830"]]
```

The metadata.tab file is returned as a _data.frame_. The first 6 rows
of the first 5 columns are shown here:

```{r}
metadata.tab[1:6, 1:5]
```

One can keep constructing different queries using multiple arguments to 
trim down these `r length(epiFiles)` to get the files one wants. 
For example, to get the ChIP-Seq files for consolidated epigenomes, 
one could use

```{r}
bpChipEpi <- query(ah , c("EpigenomeRoadMap", "broadPeak", "chip", "consolidated"))
```
To get all the bigWig signal files, one can query the hub using 

```{r}
allBigWigFiles <- query(ah, c("EpigenomeRoadMap", "BigWig"))
```
To access the 15 state chromatin segmentations, one can use

```{r}
seg <- query(ah, c("EpigenomeRoadMap", "segmentations"))
```
If one is interested in getting all the files related to one sample

```{r}
E126 <- query(ah , c("EpigenomeRoadMap", "E126", "H3K4ME2"))
E126
```

Hub resources can also be selected using `$`, `subset()`, and
`display()`; see the main
[_AnnotationHub_ vignette](AnnotationHub.html) for additional detail.

Hub resources are imported as the appropriate _Bioconductor_ object
for use in further analysis.  For example, peak files are returned as
_GRanges_ objects.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
peaks <- E126[['AH29817']]
```

```{r}
peaks <- E126[['AH29817']]
seqinfo(peaks)
```

BigWig files are returned as _BigWigFile_ objects. A _BigWigFile_ is a
reference to a file on disk; the data in the file can be read in using
`rtracklayer::import()`, perhaps querying these large files for
particular genomic regions of interest as described on the help page
`?import.bw`.

Each record inside AnnotationHub is associated with a
unique identifier. Most _GRanges_ objects returned by 
AnnotationHub contain the unique AnnotationHub identifier of
the resource from which the _GRanges_ is derived.  This can come handy
when working with the _GRanges_ object for a while, and additional
information about the object (e.g., the name of the file in the cache,
or the original sourceurl for the data underlying the resource) that
is being worked with.

```{r}
metadata(peaks)
ah[metadata(peaks)$AnnotationHubName]$sourceurl
```

### Ensembl GTF TxDb gene models

_Bioconductor_ represents gene models using 'transcript'
databases. These are available via packages such as
_TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene_
or can be constructed using functions such as
`GenomicFeatures::makeTxDbFromBiomart()`.

_AnnotationHub_ provides an easy way to work with gene models
published by Ensembl. We are going to be working with human data
that are mapped to GRCh37 (hg19). We have a choice of providers (UCSC,
NCBI, Ensembl), but we will just choose Ensembl here to minimize the
amount of ID changing.

```{r ah-gene-models}
query(ah,c('gtf','ensembl','sapiens','GRCh37'))
```

We see that there is a GTF file describing gene models.
The GTF file is imported as a _GRanges_ instance, but with a number of
columns that allow the _Granges_ object to encode the complexity of
exons, CDS, and utrs.  

```{r}
gtf <- ah[['AH10684']]
head(gtf, 3)
```

It is trivial to make a transcript database, or _TxDb_, instance of
these data. We will use this _TxDb_ to quickly access gene annotation
in genome context. 

```{r gtf2txdb,cache=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(GenomicFeatures)         # for makeTxDbFromGRanges
txdb <- makeTxDbFromGRanges(gtf)
````

## Epigenomics case study

We are going to use data from the
[ENCODE project](https://www.genome.gov/10005107/)
as  a playground for using the Bioconductor ranges infrastructure. To
keep things manageable, we will focus on only the K562 leukemia cell
line and on histone marks. To keep the data smallish, but without loss
of generality, we will use data that have been processed using a
peak-caller and summarized as regions of statistically significant
regions.

Bioconductor has processed all of the ENCODE data into Bioconductor
data structures (as well as thousands of other datasets) and then
stored and made available via the
_AnnotationHub_ system we saw above. 

```{r}
query(ah,c('K562','h3k','E123','narrow'))
histoneSets = names(query(ah,c('K562','E123','h3k','narrow')))
```

The `histoneSets` variable now contains the *names* _AnnotationHub_
datasets from histone modification experiments done in K562 cells and
summarized using a bioinformatics protocol tunes to produce narrow
peaks. However, the data still need to be downloaded and then loaded
into R memory.

_To load your own peaks into R, check out the `rtracklayer::import()` function._


### Peak density across the genome


Start (arbitrarily) with the first `histoneSet` by loading the dataset.

```{r}
histonePeaks = ah[[histoneSets[1]]]
```

The first time the code above is executed, the data will be *both* downloaded *and* loaded into the variable `histonePeaks`. The _next_ time that this line is run, a "cached" version of the data will be used, so no download needs to occur the second time.


```{r}
si = seqinfo(histonePeaks)
si
```

The next block of code looks long, but the main *purpose* of the code
is to produce 100kb windows across the genomic so that we can count
the number of H3K4me1 peaks in each 100kb window. Most of the lines
are do deal with small issues of keeping chromosome names and lengths
straight when transforming our data.

```{r}
fullchroms = as(si,'GRanges')
seqinfo(fullchroms)
# 100kb bins
# This is the work--using tile()
tile0.1mb = unlist(tile(fullchroms,width=1e5))
seqinfo(tile0.1mb) = si
tile0.1mb = keepStandardChromosomes(tile0.1mb,pruning.mode = 'coarse')
histonePeaks = keepStandardChromosomes(histonePeaks,pruning.mode = 'coarse')
seqlevelsStyle(tile0.1mb) = seqlevelsStyle(histonePeaks)
histonePeaks=dropSeqlevels(histonePeaks,'chrM')
genome(tile0.1mb) = 'hg19'
```

Counting peaks in each 100kb window is *VERY* fast using the
`counterOverlaps()` method.

```{r}
tile0.1mb$peakCount = countOverlaps(tile0.1mb,histonePeaks)
```

While the following plot is not as informative as it could be,
sometimes using a circular layout is a good way to show an overview of
full genome datasets. Data on the scale of 100kb is probably still too
fine-level for such a plot.


```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggbio)
ggbio() + circle(tile0.1mb,geom='point', aes(y = peakCount),
                     color='red', alpha=0.25, size=0.25, grid=TRUE,
                     radius=60, trackWidth=30) +
    circle(tile0.1mb, geom = "scale", size = 2,radius=90) +
    circle(tile0.1mb, geom='ideo',fill='gray70')
```


Getting the `GC` content of the peaks is also straightforward. When you have two peaksets


```{r}
dnaInPeaks = getSeq(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19,histonePeaks)
percentGC = letterFrequency(dnaInPeaks,'GC',as.prob=TRUE)
```

To get a comparison set, just shift all regions to the left by 5kb (for example).

```{r}
shiftedPeaks = shift(histonePeaks,-5000)
head(ranges(histonePeaks))
# data shifted 5kb to the left
head(ranges(shiftedPeaks))
```

Grab the `GC` content and plot.


```{r}
dnaInShiftedPeaks = getSeq(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19,shift(histonePeaks,-5000))
percentGC1 = letterFrequency(dnaInShiftedPeaks,'GC',as.prob=TRUE)
plot(density(percentGC))
lines(density(percentGC1),col='red')
```


### Compare peak sets

As with many datasets in biology, learning about how data relate to
each other can be a very powerful technique for hypothesis
generation. The goal of the next section is to determine the
similarities among a set of 10 histone mark datasets in hopes of
generating some hypotheses about the functionality of the histone
marks.

Start by loading the datasets that we found above for the K562 cell line.

```{r message=FALSE}
hpList = sapply(histoneSets,function(ahname) ah[[ahname]])
# get the "titles" for the experiment
# And cleanup the messy names
hptitles = gsub('E123-|\\.narrowPeak\\.gz','',ah[histoneSets]$title)
names(hpList) = hptitles
hptitles
```

How can we compare two sets of regions? 


The Jaccard Similarity measure quantifies the proportion of shared peaks (or proportion of bases covered by the shared peaks) to that covered by the _union_ of those peak sets. In mathematical terms, the _Jaccard Index_ measures this similarity. 

 $$ J(A,B) = \frac{\left | A \bigcap B \right |}{\left | A \bigcup B \right |} $$

The _Jaccard Distance_ simply measures how dissimilar two sets of regions are (1-J(A,b)).

 $$ d_J(A,B) = 1 - J(A,B) = 1 - \frac{\left | A \bigcap B \right |}{\left | A \bigcup B \right |} $$

The `regionJaccard()` function takes as input two sets of regions and calculates the Jaccard Index using base-level overlaps (as opposed to whole-region overlaps).

```{r}
#' Calculate Jaccard Similarity between two sets of ranges
#'
#' @param a A set of ranges
#' @param b A second set of ranges
#'
#' @details We calculate the Jaccard Distance
#'     as a simple ratio of the number of
#'     shared bases in the regions to
#'     total number of bases covered by
#'     both sets.
#'
#' @return a value between 0 and 1
regionJaccard = function(a,b) {
    sum(width(intersect(a,b)))/sum(width(union(a,b)))
}
```

We can try this on two peakSets:

```{r}
regionJaccard(hpList[[1]],hpList[[2]])
```

How would you interpret the result?

To make addressing the question above a bit more intuitive, we can perform the same calculation, but between all pairs of regions using the `multiRegStat()` function below.


```{r}
multiRegStat <- function(a,b, fun) {
    res <- matrix(0L, length(a), length(b))
    for (i in seq_along(a))
    {
       for (j in seq_along(b))
       {
          res[i,j] = fun(a[[i]],b[[j]])
       }
    }
    if(!is.null(names(a))) rownames(res) = names(a)
    if(!is.null(names(b))) colnames(res) = names(b)
    
    res
}
```

```{r}
res = multiRegStat(hpList,hpList,regionJaccard)
res
```

The `res` matrix now describes the pairwise similarities between the various histone mark peak sets. Making a heatmap and annotating it with knowledge of [wikipedia, for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_code) is potentially helpful.


```{r}
library(ComplexHeatmap)
annot = data.frame(exprStatus=c('Active','Active','Active','Active',
                                'Active','Repressed','Active','Repressed',NA,'Active'),
                   locale=c(NA,NA,'Promoter','Promoter',NA,'Body','Enhancer','Body','Body',NA),
                   row.names=hptitles)
Heatmap(res,top_annotation=HeatmapAnnotation(
          df=annot,col=list(exprStatus=c('Active'='yellow',Repressed='blue'))))
```

What do you think of the plot above? 


### Histone profiles

In the following code block, we:

1. Grab the "regions" of "promoters", defined as a window around the transcript start site.
    - Subsample the promoters randomly to reduce runtime and memory usage.
2. Calculate "coverage" of our peaks. For each base in the genome, we will have a single number, mostly zeros, and some ones. 
3. Create slices of our coverage data, called "Views".
4. Convert the slices of coverage to rows of a matrix.
5. Sum the columns of the matrix to produce a summary binding profile.



```{r}
wndw = 2000
proms = promoters(txdb, upstream = wndw, downstream = wndw,
                  columns = c('tx_name','gene_id'))
proms = proms[sample(seq_along(proms),20000,replace=FALSE)]
proms = keepStandardChromosomes(proms,pruning.mode='tidy')
covg = coverage(hpList[[1]])
seqlevelsStyle(proms) = seqlevelsStyle(covg)
covg = covg[seqlevels(proms)]
vi = Views(covg,as(proms[strand(proms)=='+',],'RangesList'))
m = as.matrix(vi)
plot(colSums(m,na.rm=TRUE),type='l')
```

We can wrap all this up as a function to reuse as we see fit.

```{r}
histoneProfile = function(promoters,peaks,n_promoters=10000) {
    proms = promoters
    proms = proms[sample(seq_along(proms),min(length(proms),n_promoters),replace=FALSE)]
    proms = keepStandardChromosomes(proms,pruning.mode='tidy')
    covg = coverage(peaks)
    seqlevelsStyle(proms) = seqlevelsStyle(covg)
    covg = covg[seqlevels(proms)]
    vi = Views(covg,as(proms[strand(proms)=='+',],'RangesList'))
    return(colSums(as.matrix(vi),na.rm = TRUE))
}
```
    
Now, we are going to load gene expression for K562 so that we can look
at how the binding profiles vary with expression. The gene expression
from ENCODE data is available from many sources. In this case, we are
downloading directly from Ensembl in Europe.


```{r}
library(readr)
k562expr = read_tsv('https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF812ADD/@@download/ENCFF812ADD.tsv')
head(k562expr)
```

These data have several columns of values, including `tpm` or
transcripts-per-million, which we be using as our measure of
expression. Go ahead and take a look at the distribution and other
characteristics of the `tpm` column.

```{r}
# Fix gene names
k562expr$gene_id=sub('\\..*','',k562expr$gene_id)
k562expr = subset(k562expr,grepl('ENSG',gene_id))
```

Below, I am simply attaching the expression values to their associated
promoters based on gene id matching.


```{r}
proms$TPM = k562expr$TPM[match(unlist(proms$gene_id),k562expr$gene_id)]
proms$logTPM =
    log10(k562expr$TPM[match(unlist(proms$gene_id),k562expr$gene_id)])
head(proms)
```

Now, subset promoters into those with low expression and those with high.

```{r }
promslow = proms[which(proms$logTPM<median(proms$logTPM,na.rm=TRUE))]
promshigh = proms[which(proms$logTPM>=median(proms$logTPM,na.rm=TRUE))]
```

And finally, produce a plot of two histone marks with low and high
expression.


```{r warning=FALSE}
mat = cbind(histoneProfile(promslow,hpList[[1]]),
            histoneProfile(promshigh,hpList[[1]]),
            histoneProfile(promslow,hpList[[10]]),
            histoneProfile(promshigh,hpList[[10]]))
matplot(mat,type='l',main=paste(hptitles[1],hptitles[[10]], sep=" & "))
legend(0,2000,legend=c('H3K4me1_low','H3K4me1_high','H3K79me2_low','H3K79me2_high'),
       col=1:4,lty=1:4)
```

## `sessionInfo()`

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```
