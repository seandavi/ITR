## Data preparation

For this set of exercises, we are going to rely on a dataset that comes with R.
It gives the number of sunspots per month from 1749-1983. The dataset comes as 
a `ts` or time series data type which I convert to a matrix using the following
code. 

Just run the code as is and focus on the rest of the exercises. 

```{r}
data(sunspots)
sunspot_mat <- matrix(as.vector(sunspots),ncol=12,byrow = TRUE)
colnames(sunspot_mat) <- as.character(1:12)
rownames(sunspot_mat) <- as.character(1749:1983)
```

## Exercises

- After the conversion above, what does `sunspot_mat` look like? Use functions
to find the number of rows, the number of columns, the class, and some basic
summary statistics.

```{r}
ncol(sunspot_mat)
nrow(sunspot_mat)
dim(sunspot_mat)
summary(sunspot_mat)
head(sunspot_mat)
tail(sunspot_mat)
```

These next few exercises take advantage of the fact that calling a univariate
statistical function (one that expects a vector) works for matrices by just making
a vector of all the values in the matrix. 

- What is the highest (max) number of sunspots recorded in these data?

```{r}
max(sunspot_mat)
```

- And the minimum?

```{r}
min(sunspot_mat)
```

- And the overall mean and median?

```{r}
mean(sunspot_mat)
median(sunspot_mat)
```

- Use the `hist()` function to look at the distribution of all the monthly 
sunspot data. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
hist(sunspot_mat)
```
- Read about the `breaks` argument to `hist()` to try to increase the number of
breaks in the histogram to increase the resolution slightly. Adjust your `hist()`
and breaks to your liking.

```{r eval=FALSE}
hist(sunspot_mat, breaks=40)
```

Now, let's move on to summarizing the data a bit. 

- Examine the dataset again. What do the columns represent? And the rows?

```{r}
# just a quick glimpse of the data will give us a sense
head(sunspot_mat)
```

- We'd like to look at the distribution of sunspots by month. How can we do that?

```{r}
# the mean of the columns is the mean number of sunspots per month.
colMeans(sunspot_mat)

# Another way to write the same thing:
apply(sunspot_mat, 2, mean)
```

- Assign the month summary above to a variable and summarize it to get a sense
of the spread over months.

```{r}
monthmeans = colMeans(sunspot_mat)
summary(monthmeans)
```

- Play the same game for years to get the per-year mean?

```{r}
ymeans = rowMeans(sunspot_mat)
summary(ymeans)
```

- Make a plot of the yearly means. Do you see a pattern?

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(ymeans)
# or make it clearer
plot(ymeans, type='l')
```
