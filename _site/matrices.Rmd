A _matrix_ is a rectangular collection of the same data type. It can be viewed as a collection
of column vectors all of the same length and the same type (i.e. numeric, character or logical). A _data.frame_ is *also* a rectangular array. All of the columns must be the same length, but they may be of *different* types. The rows and columns of a matrix or data frame can be given names. However these are implemented differently in R; many operations will work for one but not both, often a source of confusion.

In this section, we will be working with matrices. The _data.frame_ will be dealt with elsewhere.

## Matrices


We start by building a matrix from parts:

```{r}
x <- 1:10 
y <- rnorm(10)

# make a matrix by column binding two numeric vectors
mat<-cbind(x,y)
mat
```

Inspecting the names associated with rows and columns is often useful, particularly if the names have human meaning. 

```{r}
rownames(mat)
colnames(mat)
```

Matrices have dimensions.

```{r}
dim(mat)
nrow(mat)
ncol(mat)
```

Indexing for matrices works as for vectors except that we now need to
include both the row and column (in that order).

```{r}
# The 2nd element of the 1st row of mat
mat[1,2]
# The first ROW of mat
mat[1,]
# The first COLUMN of mat
mat[,1]
# and all elements of mat that are > 4; note no comma
mat[mat>4]
## [1]  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

Note that in the last case, there is no ",", so R treats the matrix as a long vector (length=20). This is convenient, sometimes, but it can also be a source of error, as some code may "work" but be doing something unexpected.

In the next example, we create a matrix with 2 columns and 10 rows.

```{r}
m = matrix(rnorm(20),nrow=10)
# multiply all values in the matrix by 20
m = m*20
# and add 100 to the first column of m
m[,1] = m[,1] + 100
# summarize m
summary(m)
```
